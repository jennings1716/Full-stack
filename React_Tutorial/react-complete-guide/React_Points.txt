Components are the core building block of React apps. 
    Functional Component 
        const cmp = () => { return <div>some JSX</div> }
    Class based Component
        class Cmp extends Component { render () { return <div>some JSX</div> } }

JSX:
every JSX code is compiled in to React.createElement which has the element, configuration (class names) and the children
and that is the reason React is imported in all js files eventhough we are not using it.
It should have one root element.
To execute JS code within the html element enclose within curly braces {}

Props:
props can be used to pass the value as attributes in the Components
In class based components this.props is used
Children also passed to the component using the props: props.children

State:
It works only in class based components which extends Component.
State maintains the variables within the component.

useState hook from React gives two values i) current state ii) function to update current state

Passing method reference between components <Person click={this.funcName}/> => props.click calls the function funcName

to display the html blocks conditionally we can include the ternary operator with in curly braces { value ? <h1></h1> : null}

render function is being called everytime when react makes an update in the screen
So another way of conditional rendering of elements is by assigning the jsx code to a variable and use if conditions, which is the prefered way.

while setting new state assign the old state to a new variable, Edit the variable and set the new variable as the new state.


Styling in React:
inline styles can be changed dynamically by assigning new object.
classnames can be changed dynamically
Radium is the react npm package which is used to add pseudo selectors and media queries to the inline styles.
    Pseudoselectors:
        -add ":hover:{ }" as key to the style object
    Media Queries:
        1) Media queries require a node package called Radium:
            media_style = {
                "@media (min-width: 800px)":{
                    textAlign: "center",
                    }
                }
        <h1 style={media_style}></h1>
        2) Enclose the App and the  components using Radium: export default Radium(App)
        3) Enclose the html code using the mediaquery withing the <StyleRoot></StyleRoot>
    CSS Modules:
        To use the media queries and the pseudo selector without Radium we use something called CSS modules.
        To enable the CSS modules follow the following steps:
            i.   Commit your work if it is git project only then it will work.
            ii.  execute "npm run eject"
            iii. In the config/webpack.config.js file, Search the place " test: cssRegex,".
                 Add the two lines below importLoaders:1,
                " modules:true,
                  localIdentName:'[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]',"
             iv. Now import css file as object:-  import classes as "./x.css"
             v.replace the classnames with classes._classname_
             vi. Restart the server. (Careful while editing)
